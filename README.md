# DataScoutCompanion

### Embeddable SwiftData Inspector into your app
DataScoutCompanion is a lightweight, embeddable Swift package that provides a UI to inspect the contents of your SwiftData/CoreData/SQLite stores at runtime. It ships as a dropâ€‘in Swift Package, integrates seamlessly into SwiftUI, and lets you visualize and debug your data model without leaving your app.
This package is planned as a companion to the macOS app for debugging SwiftData [DataScout](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/datascout-for-swiftdata/id6737813684) and will be used in the future to support data synchronization between devices.
